Comply is a SOC2-focused compliance automation tool:

- **Policy Generator**: markdown-powered **document pipeline** for publishing auditor-friendly **policy documents**
- **Ticketing Integration**: automate compliance throughout the year via your existing **ticketing system**
- **SOC2 Templates**: open source policy and procedure **templates** suitable for satisfying a SOC2 audit

# Installation

macOS:

`brew tap strongdm/comply; brew install comply`

Linux:

[Download latest release](https://github.com/strongdm/comply/releases)

Go users:

`go get github.com/strongdm/comply`

# Get Started

Start with `comply init`:

```

## Running in Docker

Comply is currently only released for Linux and macOS, however from other operating systems it's possible to run using Docker:

```
# first pull the latest published docker image
$ docker pull strongdm/comply

# from an empty directory that will contain your comply project
$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/source -p 4000:4000 -it strongdm/comply
root@ec4544732298:/source# comply init
âœ— Organization Name:

# serve content live from an established project
$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/source -p 4000:4000 -it strongdm/comply
root@ae4d499583fc:/source# comply serve
Serving content of output/ at http://127.0.0.1:4000 (ctrl-c to quit)
```

For Windows users, replace $PWD with the full path to your project directory

### Running in macOS M1

If you're running Comply inside Docker, or using it installed by HomeBrew, in a macOS M1, you should increase the Docker allocatable memory space to ~7 GB, but it won't run smoothly. So, we recommend to run Comply locally with pandoc binary installed via HomeBrew. For that, install the `pandoc` and `basictex` packages using the following command:

```bash
brew install pandoc basictex
```

Then when running the Comply binary -installed by HomeBrew- it will work as expected.

## Ticketing Integrations:

- Jira
- Github
- Gitlab

## Configuration

## GitHub

Ticketing integration with GitHub can be configured with the following YAML in `comply.yml`:

```yaml
tickets:
  github:
    repo: <repo-name>
    token: <token>
    username: org or personal username
```

If you're setting up the repo in your personal account, set `username` to your username.
If you're setting up the repo in an github organization, set `username` to your org's username instead.

Also, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `GITHUB_USERNAME` can be used to override values from the YAML file.

### Jira

When comply creates a ticket (through `proc`, for instance), it sets the following fields.

- assignee
- description
- issuetype
- labels
- project key
- reporter
- summary

Please make sure that the default _Create Screen_ has all of those fields enabled. Additionally, make sure that there are no other required fields for the issue type you choose.

About authentication, you need to create an [API Token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) to use as a password.

## Forking and local development

> Assumes installation of golang and configuration of GOPATH in .bash_profile, .zshrc, etc
> Inspiration: http://code.openark.org/blog/development/forking-golang-repositories-on-github-and-managing-the-import-path

```
$ go get github.com/strongdm/comply
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/strongdm/comply ; go get ./...
$ make
$ cd example
$ mv comply.yml.example comply.yml
$ ../comply -h
$ ../comply sync
$ ../comply serve
#
$ make # recompile as needed with in $GOPATH/src/github.com/strongdm/comply
```
